                        <span class="timeline-date">Semester Abroad</span>
                        <p>Anson and Blythe first met in the Johannesburg airport for their semester abroad through the Organization for Tropical Studies! Anson first wowed Blythe by discussing how he got SIM cards from both major providers because he didn't know which would have better service, while Blythe just got the one she first saw at the airport (hers somehow managed to be more consistent).</p>
                        <p>Anson and Blythe became fast friends through the semester enjoying game rides, sundowners, and lots of fun parties with their friends! They said goodbye after that semester hoping to stay good friends.</p>

                        <span class="timeline-date">Senior Year</span>
                        <p>Anson and Blythe stayed in touch following abroad, but they really reconnected second semester senior year.</p>
                        <p>Anson blew off the first day of classes to visit Blythe in Florida and hang out for the weekend — something "just friends" totally do. Later that semester Blythe went to visit Anson at home in Fort Collins, Colorado for spring break. Another super normal just friends trip.</p>
                        <p>Following this reconnection they learned Anson would be starting work in Boston at Parthenon and Blythe would be starting grad school outside Boston at Tufts. But the two officially started dating at Anson's extended family reunion — of course a perfectly normal event for an until-then friend to attend.</p>

                        <span class="timeline-date">Six Years Together</span>
                        <p>The following six years Blythe and Anson lived in Boston, New York, Wisconsin, and Chicago. They survived COVID, moving in together, installing a tricky TV mount, and a few job changes.</p>
                        <p>They have enjoyed traveling all over the world together — some favorites have included Mexico City, Medellín, and Montreal! They have also loved building their home together in Chicago, exploring the city, hosting friends, cooking fun meals, and building out their full home bar.</p>

                        <h3>The Proposal</h3>
                        <span class="timeline-date">October 5, 2025</span>
                        <p>Anson pulled off the most beautiful surprise. They traveled up to Door County, WI — where they spent COVID and countless trips with friends and family — for apple picking. Anson managed to get Blythe to take the Monday and Tuesday off for his birthday on the 7th and scheduled a full day of their favorite things.</p>
                        <p>That evening they went for drinks — "Anson's birthday drinks," just the two of them (which Blythe should have found suspicious). Following drinks they drove down to Porcupine Bay to watch the sunset, a favorite activity for the two of them. When they got there Anson shocked Blythe by getting down on one knee and asking her, with a lengthy speech, to marry him. She said yes!! They went back to the house to celebrate with Anson's family and their friends and enjoy the rest of the week.</p>
                        <p>But the surprises didn't stop there. Upon driving home the next weekend, Anson blew Blythe away again by having all her family and friends waiting for them back in their apartment for an amazing engagement party. Blythe has truly never been so speechless before.</p>
